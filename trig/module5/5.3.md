## 5.3 The Other Trigonometric Functions

Objectives:
1. Find exact values of secant, cosecant, tangent, and cotangent 
    of π/3, π/4, and π/6.
2. Use reference angles to evaluate the trig functions secant, cosecant,
    tangent, and cotangent.
3. Use properties of even and odd trigonometric functions.
4. Recognize and use fundamental identities.
5. Evaluate trig functions with a calculator. 

# Finding Exact Values of the Trigonometric Functions:
# Secant, Cosecant, Tangent, Cotangent

The **tangent** of an angle is the ratio of the y-value to the x-value of the
  corresponding point on the unit circle. (tangent = y/x, x != 0)
  It can also be stated as *sin t/cost t, cos t != 0*

The remaining three functions are reciprocals of defined functions (sin, cos, tan):
1. **secant(sec)** is the reciprocal of the **cosine** function. -> 1/cos t = 1/x, x!=0
2. **cotangent(cot)** is the reciprocal of **tangent** function. -> cos t/sin t = x/y
3. **cosecant(csc)** is the reciprocal of the **sine** function. -> 1/sin t = 1/y, y!=0

# Example 1: Finding Trigonometric Functions from a Point on the Unit Circle
The point (-(√3)/(2), 1/2) is on the unit circle. 
  *Find sin t, cos t, tan t, sec t, csc t, cot t*

- We know that we are in quadrant 2 (negative x-value, positive y-value) [5π/6]
- x = -(√3)/(2)
- y = (1/2)

sin t = y -> 1/2 
cos t = x -> -(√3)/(2)
tan t = y/x -> 1/2/(√3/2) = √3/3
csc t = 1/1/2 -> 2
sec t = 2/-√3 -> -2√3/3
cot t = (-√3)
