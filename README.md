## Getting Started

To clone this repository, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rexnowacki/study.git
```
## Branching Strategy


- Class-specific branches: These are branches dedicated to each individual class.
  - `c-language`: For C programming assignments, exercises, and notes.
  - `project-management`: For Project Management tasks, notes, and slides.
  - `intro-to-c++`: For Intro to C++ programming assignments and exercises.
  
- Assignment-specific branches: For each assignment, project, or exercise, a new branch is created from the class-specific branch.
  - Examples: 
    - `c-language/assignment1`, `c-language/assignment2`, etc.
    - `project-management/team-project-phase1`
    - `intro-to-c++/classes-exercise`
  
- `study-material`: Contains study guides, flashcards, and other exam preparation material.

- `experiment`: For experimental code or tasks, which may or may not be merged into the main branch.

## Classes

This section provides an overview of the classes for which this repository contains material. Each class has its own dedicated branch, and assignments or exercises will generally have their own sub-branches.

### C Language

The `c-language` branch contains all materials related to the C programming class. This includes assignments, lab exercises, and potentially exam material. To check out this branch, use the following command:

```bash
git checkout c-language
```

### Project Management

The `project-management` branch is focused on Project Management coursework. This could range from class notes to project plans, and presentation slides. To switch to this branch, execute:

```bash
git checkout project-management
```

### Intro to C++

The `intro-to-c++` branch houses all materials for the Introduction to C++ class. This includes code assignments, class exercises, and other educational resources. To switch to this branch, run:

```bash
git checkout intro-to-c++
```
