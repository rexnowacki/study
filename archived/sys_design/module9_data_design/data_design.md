### Module 9 -- Data Design

## 9.1. Data Design Concepts
# 9.1.1. Data Structures
A **data structure** is a framework for organizing, storing, and managing data. They consist of 
files or tables, typically. 
Modern relational databases are the current standard.

# 9.1.2. Mario & Danica: Data Design Example
In a file oriented system, files that are not linked or connected store data. There can be
inaccuracies or redundancies in this format.

In a Database Management System (DBMS), there is not as big of a risk for data entry problems,
although they can certainly still exist. 

# 9.1.3. Database Management Systems
A **database** provides an overall framework that avoids redundancies and supports a real-time,
dynamic environment. 
A **database management system** (DBMS) is a collection of tools, features, interfaces, etc. that
enables users to add, update, manage, access, and analyze data. It comes with the following advantages.
  1. **Scalability**: A system can be expanded, modified, or easily downsized to meet changing needs.
  2. **Economy of Scale**: Allows better utilization of hardware.
  3. **Enterprise-wide application**: Managed by database administrator. 
  4. **Stronger standards**: Data names, formats, documentation are followed uniformly. 
  5. **Better security**: The DBA can define authorization procedures to ensure that only legitimate
      users can access the database and can allow different users to have different access permissions.
  6. **Data independence**: Data structures can be modified without altering information systems that
      use the data.
