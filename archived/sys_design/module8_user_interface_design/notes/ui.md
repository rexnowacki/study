### User Interface Design & Evaluation

## Part II

1. How would you define usability?

       I would define usability in the context of UI design as a measurement of how easy 
       users of a system can learn, understand and navigate a product and can successfully
       use a product to achieve whatever goal's they are using it for with minimal frustrations.
       From a UI perspective, a product should be intuitive, efficient, and hopefully somewhat
       pleasant to use.

2. How would you measure a system's usability? Suppose your development team has created
   a prototype of a UI for a new system. Describe how you might test and measure the
   usability of your UI.

        1. Find representative users -- preferable people whose experience aligns with 
           the potential user base.
        2. Come up with a representative task. For an e-commerce site, it might be something
           like finding an item, adding it to the cart, and going through the checkout process.
        3. Record and observe how the user interacts with the system -- find spots where the
           UI is intuitive and the user has no problem -- also find spots where they have trouble
           with the interface.

3. Describe the differences between UI design in a web environment and UI design in a
   desktop environment. Are there good / bad deeds in UI design that would be important
   for a desktop system but not for a browser-based system?

           Desktop applications can full access to the resources on the machine/server they 
           run on. This can mean improved performance. Web apps may be constrained by the
           limits of the browser they run in and may not have full access to resources. 

           Given this, desktop applications may run "snappier" and be more responsive. 

           Browser compatability and response design is important for browser-based systems. 
           They need to be able to run a number of different browsers and need to have good
           design at multiple sizes/resolutions. Users can likely be more forgiving of small
           issues in a browser-based system. Users of a desktop application will expect a
           rich, responsive, and more powerful UI and will be less forgiving of poor 
           performance. 

4. Usability-related IT jobs are now common. Add 3 usability jobs to your IT jobs table from
   Assignment 1. Examples: Usability Engineer, Usability Researcher, Human Factors Analyst

5. What is a prototype? What can be learned from building a prototype of a proposed system?

            A prototype is a model of a proposed product. Developing a prototype can help you
            answer important questions:

            Is my product feasible?
            What will my product look like for a user?
            How will my user interact with the system?

            These are things you should already have in mind -- but the prototype will help
            expose any holes or shortcomings you may have overlooked.

6. What is User Testing? Look online for a description of a large company's User Testing lab.

       The Usability Labs determine how useful products are by attempting to provide answers to three 
       equally important questions:

        Does the product do something customers want?

        Can people use the product to do what it is designed to do?

        Is the product desirable?

7. Describe the lab's layout & the testing process.

        To answer these questions, the Usability Labs employs engineers with a wide variety of educational
        backgrounds, including human-factors psychology, social psychology, industrial engineering, technical 
        communications, developmental psychology, information science and computer science.

        A separate group, the Usability Test Coordinators, recruit outside users to spend a few hours at 
        the Microsoft corporate campus working with the products Microsoft is developing. The Usability 
        Engineers and Test Coordinators work closely together to bring in users whose work and experience 
        are appropriate for the product theyâ€™ll be testing. By observing customers actually using a product,
        the engineers can determine how well the product meets their needs and whether it is easy to use.


8. What is Heuristic Evaluation? What are its advantages & disadvantages compared with User
   Testing?

        Heuristic evaluation is a method for identifying design problems in a user interface. It differs
        with User Testing in that it is conducted by an usability expert. The design is judged against
        a set of guidelines (heuristics).

        It's advantages include:
          * More cost-effective
          * Can be done more quickly
          * Early Identification: Issues can be caught early in design

        Disadvantages include:
          * May miss issues real users might encounter.
          * Dependent on experts' expertise.
          * Limited Feedback, may not give a good picture of usability and satisfaction for user
