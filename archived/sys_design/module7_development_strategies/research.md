1. **Cost-Savings and Efficiency**:
   - Cloud-based solutions often result in cost savings compared to traditional on-premises solutions. These savings come from eliminating capital expenses in favor of operating expenses, reducing the demand on IT staff, and decreasing personnel costs ([Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/01/28/the-roi-of-the-cloud/)).
   - The startup Coder suggests that cloud-based development environments can help software engineers work faster and more efficiently, which could lead to a quicker time to market ([IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/software-development-environments-cloud)).

2. **ROI Measurement**:
   - ROI on cloud investments can be a complex and dynamic analysis, requiring consideration of initial investment, implementation costs, and support costs. It's essential to measure the ROI based on the organization's goals and the specific factors driving the move to the cloud, such as reducing costs, improving time to market, and enhancing business agility ([Capgemini](https://www.capgemini.com)).
   - A specific measure of Cloud ROI is the impact a cloud investment has on an organization, usually indicated by a positive influence on the organization's bottom line ([VMware](https://www.vmware.com)).

3. **Comparative ROI**:
   - Nucleus Research found that the ROI of cloud-based solutions was significantly higher than on-premises solutions, with the ROI gap widening over the years. As of their latest report in November 2020, cloud-based solutions delivered an ROI that was 4.01 times greater than on-premises solutions and were 2.5 times quicker to deploy ([Forbes](https://www.forbes.com)).

4. **Monetary Value Generation**:
   - McKinsey estimated that cloud adoption could generate about $3 trillion in EBITDA value by 2030, suggesting a substantial ROI for businesses adopting cloud technologies ([McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com)).

5. **Business Agility and Scalability**:
   - Cloud-based solutions provide better scalability and business agility, allowing organizations to respond quickly to market changes and grow their operations without significant upfront investments ([Capgemini](https://www.capgemini.com)).

6. **Additional Benefits**:
   - Other notable benefits include supporting remote work initiatives, reducing the cost of mergers and acquisitions, improving user adoption, and enabling low/no-code app development, which can contribute to a positive ROI ([Forbes](https://www.forbes.com)).

The ROI of cloud-based software development environments is a multifaceted issue, and the precise ROI can vary based on the specifics of the organization and the implementation. However, the consensus among various sources suggests that cloud-based environments offer a substantial ROI, primarily through cost savings, efficiency improvements, business agility, and the ability to scale operations.
