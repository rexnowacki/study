## Agile Development Assignment

# Part I

Write a brief history of Agile development. Who started it? When? What are its main 
characteristics? What separates Agile techniques from other iterative life cycle techniques?
What are its advantages & disadvantages?

Agile development is a methodology that has become overwhelmingly popular in the world of
project management/software development. Agile officially launched in 2001 with the release
of the *Agile Manifesto*. There are four major principles to agile project management:
1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan

Agile differs from other iterative life cycle techniques in that it is more focused on adaptability
versus rigidity, it involve customer feedback and interaction throughout the development cycle, and
there is more emphasis on people and collaboration rather than rigid processes and tooling. 

It has many advantages -- it is flexible, meaning it can adapt to changing requirements. The fact 
that customers are continuously involved leads to greater satisfaction outcomes and allows the 
project manager to identify and address project risks early. The biggest advantage is how it allows
for a faster release schedule. 

There are also several disadvantages -- for instance -- it's less flexible nature makes it less
predictable which can lead to scope creep and difficulties in regards to timelines and budgets. The
fact that it relies on continuous interactions from the customer can also cause difficulties. It may
also not be the right fit for certain teams who are not naturally collaborative.

Scrum is an iterative and incremental Agile framework for managing software product
development.
Describe the following:
The history of Scrum
Each of the roles & responsibilities in the Scrum process
The Sprint
o What are the activities in a Sprint?
o Are there meetings?
o How do you know when a Sprint is done?
o What Artifacts are produced during a Sprint?
o The Product Backlog & Product Backlog Items
Scrum terminology, like Scrum-But, Tracer Bullet, & Sashimi.

The idea for Scrum was taken from a 1986 Harvard Business Review article called "The New New
Product Development Game" by Takeuchi and Nonaka. The article was about the effectiveness of 
cross-functional teams developing products via an "everybody-in" approach. 

It was adapted to the software development business in 1993 by Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber. 
They would go on to publish several papers and books, including "The Scrum Guide", which outlined
the framework. 

Roles & Responsibilities in Scrum
1. Product Owner: Responsible for maximizing product value; they manage the Product Backlog and
   make sure it is transparent and clear.
2. Scrum Master: Facilitator for the team and Product Owner. They help everyone understand Scrum
   theory, practices, and rules. 
3. Dev Team: Do the work of delivering a releasable increment of "done" product at the end of 
   each sprint. 

A sprint is a specified tperiod of time during which a "done" potentially usable product is created.

**Activities & Meetings**:
1. Sprint Planning -- determine what will be delivered and how to achieve it. 
2. Daily Scrum: A 15-minute timed event for the Dev team to synchronize activities and create a plan
   for the next 48 hours.
3. Sprint Review: Held at the end of the sprint to review the "increment".
4. Sprint Retrospective: The team discusses what went right and what went wrong and what will be
    committed to the next sprint. 

The sprint is done when the agreed upon time period is over (usually 2-4 weeks) and the Sprint Goal
   is achieved. 

Artifacts Produced:
1. Product Increment: The sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and all previous
   sprints.
2. Sprint Backlog: A set of items selected for the sprint, plus a plan for delivering the product
   increment and achieving the Sprint Goal. 

The product Backlog is an **ordered list** of everything that is known to be needed for the product. 
Product Backlog items are the individual tasks or requirements that make up the backlog.

Scrum-But: a situation where a team is using Scrum, but with modifications that may or may not lead
        to inefficiency.
Tracer Bullet: A development approach to explore unknown areas of the project.
Sashimi: describes a way of ensuring that every piece of work is fully developed and tested.

# Part III
Many development teams are using hybrid versions of Scrum, which Scrum purists say isn't
using Scrum at all. Find a company that uses Agile development techniques, & describe their
situation. What motivated them to switch to Agile/Scrum? Are they happy with it? Has it been
a success or a failure?

Many successful software companies use Scrum techniques, but it has become very common to use Scrum
where it fits and to discard it in other places. Netflix, for example, uses a hybrid version of Scrum.
Netflix adopted Agile due to the fact that it needed to respond quickly to market changes and
technological advancements. Agile allowed them to increase the speed of their development cycle and
quickly improve the quality of their product. The speed at which they did so was pivotal in their success,
as they were one of the first to have a beautifully intuitive UI, advanced algorithms for searches
and providing user recommendations, etc. 

While they do not strictly adhere to Scrum methods, Netflix has been happy with their hybrid Agile
approach -- it is allowed them to maintain their position as a leader in streaming and they have 
become and "IT" company that people desperately want to work at.
