## Conics

# Parts of a cone
- A fixed line is called the **axis** of the cone (up through center)
- The **vertex** is the point shared by both cones
- The lines that pass through the vertex and form the cones
  are the **generators**. The generators lie in the cone.
- The cone consists of two parts called the **nappes**.
- A **conic section** is a curve generated by intersecting a right
  circular cone with a plane.

# Four non-degenerate conic sections
- Circle
    -- Generated when the plane is *perpendicular* to the axis of 
      the cone.
- Parabola
    -- Generated when the plane is tilted so it intersects each
       generator, but only intersects one *nappe*.
- Ellipse
    -- Generated when the plane is *tilted* so it is **parallel** 
       to one generator only, intersects one nappe. 
- Hyperbola
    -- Generated when the plane intersects both **nappes**.


## The Circle

# Standard Form of an Equation of a Circle

* A **Circle** is the set of points (x, y) which are a fixed
  distance (r), the radius, away from a fixed point (h, k), the center.

* (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = (r)^2

```** Example: Graph the Circle
(x-3)^2 + (y+2)^2 = 16
    r == 4,
    h == 3, // Notice it is the opposite as it appears
    k == -2, // Notice it is opposite as it appears
```
## The Ellipse

* **An Ellipse** is the set of points (x, y), the sum whose 
  distances from two fixed points called the **foci** is constant.

# Standard Form of an Equation of an Ellipse
* The standard form of the equation of an ellipse with center (h, k)
  and major and minor axis of lengths 2a and 2b, where a>b is:
      (x-h)^2/a^2 + (y-k)^2/b^2 = 1 // Major axis is horizontal
      (x-h)^2/b^2 + (y-k)^2/a^2 = 1 // Major axis is vertical
  
* The **foci** lie on the major axis, *c* units from the center, 
  with (a)^2 = (b)^2 + (c)^2

* Go back and learn how to graph this.

## The Parabola

* **A parabola** is set of all points(x,y) that are
equidistant from a fixed line called the directrix and a fixed 
point called the **focus**.
